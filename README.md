# R-data-science-projects
These are three out of the six tested activities carried out during the Fundamentals in Applied Data Science course at the University of Ottawa in Fall 2023. These tested activities were carried out in a 2-person group and the workload was divided equally and/or carried out together in discussion (specially the decision tree question) and peer reviewed for errors. The questions are not provided to ensure no plagiarism occurs.  
Different datasets were used in the activities.  
All R code are presented with outcomes in each of the PDF documents shared.
